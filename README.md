# Weather Classifier using Transfer Learning on VGG19
## Overview
This project focuses on building a weather classifier using transfer learning on the VGG19 convolutional neural network. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of weather images sourced from Kaggle, providing it with the ability to classify images into different weather categories.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijaygiitk/multiclass-weather-dataset) and includes a variety of weather images. Due credit and appreciation to Kaggle for providing this valuable dataset.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:

Keras
OpenCV (cv2)

## Usage
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies using 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
Run the main script to train and evaluate the weather classifier.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific requirements. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request, I look forward to any and all feedbacks on my work.

Happy coding!
